# Sprint_security_JWT
This project demonstrates how to implement Spring Security with JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication and authorization in a ReactJS application.


When a user authenticates with an application, the application generates a JWT token that contains the user's identity and claims. The JWT token is then sent to the client, typically in the form of an HTTP header or an HTTP cookie.

When the client makes a request to the application, it includes the JWT token in the request. The application verifies the signature of the JWT token to ensure that it has not been tampered with. If the signature is valid, the application decodes the token and extracts the claims. The claims are then used to determine the user's identity and permissions.
